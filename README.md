App made to record Workout Results of Fit Test from Insanity Workout, track progress and compare yourself with friends.

## Motivation

Taking up the challenge to complete the Insanity Workout Programm, I wanted to track my results and compare them with my friends'results. 
Through this App, I had good opportunities to implement a Multi-Screen App, Cloud Based Backend (Firebase), User Authentication, TableView, CollectionView, ScrollView.
